## ðŸ§  Task 2 â€“ Image & Video Segmentation using YOLOv8
This task focuses on applying YOLOv8 segmentation to both a set of static images and video frames. The goal is to practice object segmentation on real-world inputs and build end-to-end workflows using Ultralytics YOLOv8.

âœ… What I Did
- Performed segmentation on multiple local images using YOLOv8n-seg.pt
- Downloaded a 20-second street video from Kaggle
- Extracted video frames using FFmpeg
- Applied YOLOv8 segmentation to all frames
- Reconstructed the segmented frames into a new video using FFmpeg
- Maintained a clean folder structure and modularized the task into two notebooks

ðŸ“Œ Output
- Segmented images stored in output_images/
- Segmented video saved in output_video/segmented_output.mp4
